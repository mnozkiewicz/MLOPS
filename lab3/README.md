# Lab 3 - Data processing

This lab concerns working with data processing frameworks, used for data transformation
and feature engineering in MLOps. We will focus on filtering, merging, and cleaning data,
as essential preprocessing operations.

**Learning plan**
We will focus on Polars framework:

1. DataFrames
2. Data selecting, filtering and aggregation
3. Data cleaning
4. Processing modes

**Necessary software**
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- Python 3.11

Note that you should also activate `uv` project and install dependencies with `uv sync`.

**Lab**

[Lab instruction](notebook_polars.ipynb) is a single Jupyter Notebook.

**Homework**

See [homework instruction](HOMEWORK.md).

**Data**

For the lab, we will be using [New York City yellow taxis](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)
