# Lab 6 - data & models testing

This lab concerns testing data quality, model behavioral testing, and explainability.
Those operations are crucial part of data-centric AI approach, and constitute a large
part of MLOps quality assurance.

**Learning plan**
1. Data quality testing:
   - confident learning
   - detecting & fixing data quality issues
   - CleanLab
2. Model behavioral testing:
   - input perturbations and behavioral testing
   - Giskard 
3. ML explainability:
   - local explainability
   - gradient-based attribution methods
   - Captum

**Necessary software**
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

Note that you should also activate `uv` project and install dependencies with `uv sync`.
