## Lab 7

I split the lab tasks to two notebooks. The [lab.ipynb](./lab.ipynb) contains the parts I run locally on cpu, so the first 3 excercises and the 6th one. The [lab_cuda.ipynb](./lab_cuda.ipynb) notebook contains the solutions for excercises 4 and 5 that require the usage of cuda. \\

The [apis](./apis/) folder contains the Dockerfiles for the task 6 and code for FastApi apis both for torch and onnx case.
